WORK IN PROGRESS

-Gemedet is a game discribed in the Myst series, similar to connect 4, but played on a 9x9x9 grid and 6 in a row needed to win 
   the game, this row can be on any axis including diagonal
-Game currently supports only "hotseat" 2 player mode, with player 1 selecting a possition to place their gem, and then the other
   player taking the controles
-Game is played with the Red and Green team, due to the in-game discription in Myst
-Holding down the right mouse button allows you to move the camera around a fixed point
-Holding down the left & right mouse buttons allows you to zoom the camera in
-Left clicking a colourless gem will turn it to your colour. (note at the current time, pressing left and right to zoom the camera
   can also select a gem if the mouse button is currently hovering over a selectable gem)
-Currently there is no option to change the moment speed of the camera, this will be added soon
-The slider on the right side allows you to select wich level of the grid to show, the top of the slider shows all potential
   places and currently used gems, the very bottom of the slider shows nothing but the currently used gems.
-When 6 gems in a row are of the same colour, the game will present a win screen with the option to reset and play again or to exit.
